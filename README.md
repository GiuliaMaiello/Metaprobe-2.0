# Metaprobe-2.1
The Metaprobe: a nimble, low-cost environmental DNA sampler for upscaling acquatic monitoring 

Bezombes F., Maiello G., Mariani S., Neave E., Russo T., Shum P.

The project2.1 folder contains a new 3D project to print a 2.1 version of the metaprobe, in the same original design and with a reduction of the discard plastic material.
We thanks Thomas Byrne for this updated project.

If you are still interested in the older 2.0 design, you can request it directly from the authors.

This repository contains all the instruction you need to prepare and use the Metaprobe, a hollow perforated spherical probe that when filled with rolls of gauze is used as a low-cost and low-effort eDNA sampler in acquatic environments. 
In the **project** folder you can find all the files to 3D print your own Metaprobes. In the **tutorial** folder there are protocols explaining how to prepare and use a Metaprobe with the rolls of gauze.

Here is the link to a YouTube video showing everything you need to do to use a Metaprobe: https://player.vimeo.com/video/744958355?h=4112059eef
